Someone suggested using Ansible to do all this repeatable setup. I think it was
Ansible - uses yaml config to specify what is needed.

 - setup for Haskell development
   - ghc, ghci
   - cabal
   - updated cabal
   - haskell mode for text editors
   - haskell syntax highlighting for text editors
 - setup for Helm development
   - depend on Haskell development script
   - share this script with Helm project people
