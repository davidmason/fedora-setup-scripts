# This script aims to set up all the usual applications I want on my work
# laptop, such as browsers, IRC, text editors, SDKs, IDEs and libraries.
#
# It should be run as root, although I could maybe get it working with sudo.


# Update all existing applications and libraries to the latest versions
yum update -y

# Install xmonad
yum install -y xmonad

# Install and configure IRC client
# TODO polari does not seem sufficiently configurable, look at alternatives.
yum install -y polari

# Install Keepass (seems to be already installed anyway)
yum install -y keepassx

# In case git is not installed
yum install -y git



# TODO all of the following:

# Configure xmonad to be the window manager
# The instructions say to modify ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc and add
# "exec xmonad" as the last line in the file, commenting out any other
# window manager.
#
# I should not do this until I am ready to learn how to make xmonad work.
# It may be not-completely-obvious and I'm not sure what it will do to the
# gnome 3 interface I have now.
#
# I read on unix.stackexchange.com that `Ctrl+Alt+F1` opens TTY1, where you
# can run window managers by running e.g. `xinit metacity -- :1`, so that
# could be handy.
# Someone also says to use "GDM" to choose a window manager, adding a .desktop
# file for xmonad so that GDM can recognize it. There is help on GDM (Gnome
# Display Manager) on help.gnome.org. It describes .desktop files and mentions
# ~/.dmrc ini file that specifies the session and language.
#
# It looks like there is already an xmonad.desktop file, probably added by
# IT since I don't remember installing xmonad at all (I may have though).
# So that should be available to GDM, and I need to figure out how to switch
# it.
# AHA! On the login screen there is a gear icon next to the main button, which
# allows selecting gnome or xmonad. It works, but there is an error when it
# runs the xmonad config file.
#
# According to the docs on the xmonad website, there is a different way to
# have xmonad replace metacity as the default window manager in GNOME, while
# keeping all the GNOME daemons etc. running. This looks like something I will
# want to do. I expect to have 3 options in GDM: GNOME, xmonad and GNOME+xmonad
# to cover each scenario and see which I prefer.


# Configure polari to connet to my Red Hat and Freenode IRC channels, and
# ideally add a few shortcuts to channels that are not connected by default,
# if Polari can do that.
